# Website Login Application (DXC Task)
A website implementing basic login functionalities with Spring Boot (Spring MVC, Spring Data JDBC) using traditional MVC website design (i.e., server-side created views are sent to the web browser), 
Thymeleaf as the server-side HTML5 template engine, and H2 as the embedded RDBMS to store user account details.

# How to Use
## 1. Run and Access the Website Locally
Run the project through Spring Boot, and then access http://localhost:8080/login for the login page.
## 2. Use Predefined User Accounts
Two accounts have been predefined in the database, with one being a normal user account and the other an admin account.
  1. Username: Tom, Password: abc123! **(user)**
  2. Username: Jerry, Password: !@#$%1 **(admin)**
